            <h1>AWS Community Day Malta - Code of Conduct</h1>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                At AWS Community Day Malta, we are dedicated to fostering a positive, inclusive, and supportive
                environment where all participants can learn, connect, and thrive. We believe that everyone benefits
                from an event atmosphere that encourages open dialogue, respectful communication, and a collaborative
                exchange. By adhering to these principles, we can create a space where everyone feels valued and
                empowered to contribute.
            </p>

            <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respectful Communication:</strong> Engage with others respectfully, recognizing and valuing
                    diverse perspectives. Thoughtful and considerate dialogue enhances the learning experience for all.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration and Support:</strong> Participate actively and authentically. Offer help when
                    you can, and be open to receiving it. Our community thrives when we support each other.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Professional Conduct:</strong> Maintain professionalism in all interactions, both in-person
                    and online. Use language that is inclusive and constructive, and be mindful of how your actions
                    impact those around you.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
            <p>While we try focus on positive behaviors, it's important to be clear about what is not acceptable at the
                event:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harassment or Discrimination:</strong> Any form of harassment or discrimination, including
                    offensive comments or behavior related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
                    appearance, race, religion, or other protected categories, will not be tolerated.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Disruptive Actions:</strong> Disruptive behaviors that hinder others' participation or
                    interfere with the event will be addressed promptly.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Misuse of Facilities:</strong> Any attempt to take advantage of the venueâ€™s infrastructure
                    or amenities to cause harm or damage to other participants or their property is strictly prohibited.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Participants who engage in unacceptable behavior may face consequences, including warnings, expulsion
                from the event without a refund, or, in severe cases, involvement of local law enforcement. Our goal is
                to maintain a safe and welcoming environment, and we will take appropriate action to ensure this.
            </p>

            <h2>Reporting Guidelines</h2>
            <p>
                If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to a member
                of the event staff immediately. Event staff will be clearly identifiable, and they are committed to
                addressing concerns promptly and effectively. For issues that arise after the event, or in online
                spaces, you can reach out to us directly at info@awscommunityday.mt.
            </p>
